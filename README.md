# [WIP] JS cardio challenges :computer:

Here are my answers to the JS challenges available in @bradtraversy [javascript_cardio](https://github.com/bradtraversy/javascript_cardio) and in [JS Challenger](https://www.jschallenger.com/)

This repo is still in progress so in the future I'll update it with more answers and/or some refactoring. I might add challenges from others sources too.
